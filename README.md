# Model_Checker
The aim of this project is to develop a model checker that can be applied in the teaching of software engineering. 
The application is currently a prototype for this model checker and contains some initial features. 
The prototype uses features of the [transitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) library. This library and its diagram extension must be installed in order to run the application.
